# Production Migration: Monolith → Microservices (single server)

> Deployment runbook for cutting the live monolith over to the microservices
> stack **on one server**. Pair it with [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) (deploy

> Single-server trade-offs (no fault isolation, shared blast radius, one box to
> max out) are accepted on purpose — this is a pet project. This doc does not
> re-argue that.

## 0. What actually changes

| | Monolith (today) | Microservices (target) |
|---|---|---|
| Backend processes | 1 (`api`) | 8 (`gateway` + 7 services) |
| Public entry | `api.DOMAIN` → monolith | `api.DOMAIN` → **gateway** → services |
| Postgres | 1 DB (`sallevate`) | 5 logical DBs (`identity`/`learning`/`gamification`/`ai`/`social`) on the **same** instance |
| Mongo | `sallevate` (2 collections) | same `sallevate` DB, split by collection (ai: `dialog_sessions`, social: `chat_conversations`) |
| Redis | 1 instance | 2 instances (`redis` + `analytics-redis`) |
| New infra | — | **Kafka** (KRaft) + kafka-ui + kafka-exporter |
| Frontend | Vercel | Vercel (unchanged — not on this server) |

The frontend stays on Vercel. The only thing the frontend needs is that
`api.DOMAIN` keeps answering — and it does, because the gateway now owns that host.

---

## 1. Resource impact (how much bigger the box must be)

**There is no GPU anywhere and that does not change.** All AI is external HTTP
(OpenAI-compatible LLM, Whisper STT, Yandex/Google TTS). GPU need = **0 → 0**.

The cost is **RAM**, then disk, then a bit of CPU. Going from 1 .NET process to
8, plus adding a JVM (Kafka) and a second Redis, is the real jump.

### Steady-state RAM (rough working set, idle-to-light load)

| Component | Monolith | Microservices |
|---|---|---|
| .NET backend(s) | 1 × ~250 MB | 8 × ~120–180 MB ≈ **1.2–1.5 GB** |
| Postgres | ~150 MB | ~250 MB (5 DBs, more connections) |
| Mongo | ~150 MB | ~150 MB |
| Redis | ~30 MB | 2 × ~30 MB |
| **Kafka (JVM)** | — | **~600 MB–1 GB** |
| kafka-ui (JVM) | — | ~300–400 MB |
| kafka-exporter | — | ~20 MB |
| Loki + Prometheus + Grafana | ~500 MB | ~600 MB (more series/log volume) |
| MinIO | ~150 MB | ~150 MB |
| **Total working set** | **~1.5–2 GB** | **~4.5–6 GB** |

### Build-time RAM (the real spike)

`docker compose up --build` compiles **8 .NET images** instead of 1. Each
`dotnet publish` is memory-hungry; building several in parallel can momentarily
need **3–5 GB extra**. The 4 GB swap from `SERVER_SETUP.md` keeps this from OOM-ing
but builds get slow if you rely on swap. Mitigations: build images in CI / a
registry and `pull` on the server, or build services one at a time.

### CPU

- **Idle:** low. 8 .NET services idle are cheap; Kafka idles at a few % of one core.
- **Under load:** roughly additive to the monolith; the new tax is Kafka
  broker work + JSON (de)serialization of events between services. Budget **+1
  vCPU** over what the monolith used.
- **Build:** the spike — wants all cores. Same mitigation as RAM (build off-box).

### Disk

| | Monolith | Microservices |
|---|---|---|
| Images | 1 backend + 1 frontend + infra | **8 backend** + frontend + Kafka/kafka-ui images |
| Volumes | pg, mongo, redis, loki, prom, grafana, minio | + `analytics_redis_data`, **`kafka_data`** (grows with retention), bigger Loki/Prom |

Budget **+10–20 GB** for images and Kafka/observability data; watch Kafka log
retention and Loki/Prometheus retention. `deploy-prod.sh` already prunes dangling
images and build cache >72 h.

### Bottom line — server sizing

| | Was enough for monolith | Recommended for microservices |
|---|---|---|
| vCPU | 2 | **4** |
| RAM | 4 GB | **8 GB** (6 GB is the floor and will swap during builds) |
| Disk | 40 GB | **60–80 GB** SSD |
| GPU | none | none |

On Timeweb (Amsterdam), that's about one tier up from the monolith box. 8 GB RAM
is the line that matters most — at 4 GB the stack will not hold all services +
Kafka + builds.

---

## 2. Prerequisites (once)

- [ ] Server sized per §1 (4 vCPU / 8 GB / 60–80 GB). Keep the 4 GB swap from `SERVER_SETUP.md`.
- [ ] DNS unchanged: `DOMAIN`, `*.DOMAIN` → server IP. `api.DOMAIN` already used; the gateway takes it over.
- [ ] Root `.env` filled (see [.env.example](../.env.example)) — same secrets as the monolith **plus** nothing new is mandatory; the Kafka/Redis hostnames are internal defaults. Review the optional **OPERATIONAL TUNABLES** block if you want to change LLM model / token limits / voices / token lifetimes from `.env`.
- [ ] **Switch `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` to `Production`** for a real prod deploy (the compose file ships `Development`, which exposes Swagger). Either edit the env lines or export `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production` and templatize them.
- [ ] **Full backup taken** (see §3). Do not skip — this is the rollback.

---

## 3. Backup (the rollback safety net)

Run **before** touching anything. The migration is read-only on the monolith DB,
but back up regardless.

```bash
# On the server, from the repo root (adjust container/creds to your stack):
TS=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
mkdir -p ~/backups/$TS

# Postgres (the monolith DB)
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" \
  | gzip > ~/backups/$TS/monolith-pg.sql.gz

# Mongo
docker compose exec -T mongo mongodump --archive --db=sallevate \
  | gzip > ~/backups/$TS/mongo-sallevate.archive.gz

# Snapshot the whole VM too if Timeweb offers it (one click = cheapest rollback).
```

---

## 4. Cutover order

The DB-per-service split needs the empty schemas to exist *before* data is copied,
because the services own their migrations. So the order is: **bring services up
once (they self-create their DBs+tables) → stop them → copy data → start again.**

### Step 1 — Deploy code, let services bootstrap their schemas

```bash
cd ~/sellevate            # repo root on the server
git pull --ff-only
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

On first start each relational service runs `DatabaseBootstrapper.EnsureDatabaseExistsAsync()`
(creates its DB if missing) then `Database.Migrate()` (creates its tables). After a
minute the databases `identity`, `learning`, `gamification`, `ai`, `social` exist —
**empty** — next to the still-present monolith `sallevate` DB on the same Postgres.

Verify:
```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d postgres -c "\l"
# expect: sallevate (monolith) + identity, learning, gamification, ai, social
```

### Step 2 — Stop the services that write Postgres (freeze the copy window)

Leave infra (postgres/mongo/redis/kafka/minio) running; stop the app services so
nothing writes mid-copy:

```bash
docker compose stop gateway identity learning gamification ai social analytics notification
```

(Brief downtime starts here. For a pet project this is fine; total window is the
copy time, usually seconds-to-minutes depending on data size.)

### Step 3 — Run the data split

`scripts/migrate-monolith-to-services.sh` copies each owned table from the
monolith DB into the right service DB and seeds the `UserReplicas` projections.
It is **read-only on the monolith** and refuses to overwrite non-empty targets
unless `--force`.

> **No `psql`/`pg_dump` needed on the host.** The script auto-detects the running
> `postgres` container and runs the Postgres tools *inside* it (so the client
> version always matches the server — an older host `pg_dump` would refuse to dump
> a newer server). Force the mode with `PG_MODE=docker` / `PG_MODE=host` if needed.
> `--dry-run` also prints a **column-parity report**: if any monolith column is
> missing in a service table, it's flagged there instead of failing mid-load.

```bash
# Dry run first — shows the table→service plan, row counts, and column parity; writes nothing:
./scripts/migrate-monolith-to-services.sh --dry-run

# Real run (PG host/port/creds + monolith DB name are read from .env):
./scripts/migrate-monolith-to-services.sh
```

What it does, exactly:
- **identity** ← `Users`, `UserProfiles`, `RefreshTokens`, `EmailVerificationCodes`, `DefaultAvatars`
- **learning** ← all content (`Skills`, `Lessons`, `Exercises`, `Techniques`, …) + user progress; renames `UserTechniqueProgressRecords` → `UserTechniqueProgress`
- **ai** ← `DialogBundles`, `DialogModes`
- **gamification** ← `UserXpRecords`, `UserStreaks`, `Achievements`, `UserAchievements`, `Leagues`/tiers/memberships/settings, rewards, milestones
- **social** ← `Friendships`, all `Discuss*`
- **UserReplicas** ← seeded in ai/gamification/social/learning from monolith `Users` (UserId, DisplayName, AvatarKey)

Not copied on purpose: `Notifications` (now Redis), `OpenQuestionGlobalContexts`
(not in any service schema), and content the services re-seed on startup
(`GamificationSettings`, `LeagueSettings`, `Achievements` definitions, `DefaultAvatars`,
SuperAdmin). **Mongo is not touched** — it already shares the `sallevate` DB,
split by collection.

### Step 4 — Start everything and verify

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Health gate — wait for every service to be ready:
```bash
for s in identity learning gamification ai social analytics notification gateway; do
  printf '%s: ' "$s"
  docker compose exec -T "$s" sh -c 'wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/readyz || echo DOWN'
  echo
done
```

Then functional smoke test (through the public gateway):
- [ ] `https://DOMAIN` loads (Vercel frontend) and talks to `api.DOMAIN`
- [ ] Log in (Google OAuth + super-admin) — exercises identity + JWT
- [ ] Open a skill/lesson — learning content present (counts match the monolith)
- [ ] Profile shows real XP / streak — gamification replica + data intact
- [ ] Friends / discuss list loads — social data intact
- [ ] Start a roleplay dialog — ai-service + Mongo `dialog_sessions`
- [ ] Notifications panel loads (Redis)
- [ ] Grafana (`grafana.DOMAIN`): Kafka consumer-lag dashboard healthy, no DLQ growth

### Step 5 — Decommission the monolith DB (later, not now)

Keep the `sallevate` monolith DB **read-only and untouched** for a few days as a
hot rollback. Once you trust the new stack, you can drop it — but **show the SQL
and take a fresh backup first** (project safety rule). Don't rush this.

---

## 5. Rollback

Because the migration only *reads* the monolith DB and *adds* new service DBs,
rollback is clean:

1. `docker compose stop` the microservice app containers.
2. Redeploy the monolith (the `monolith-legacy` branch / tag — see below) and
   point `api.DOMAIN` back at it.
3. The monolith `sallevate` DB was never modified, so it resumes exactly as before.

If a copy went wrong but you want to retry the split (not roll back), re-run the
script with `--force` — it truncates the target tables and reloads.

---

## 6. Branch layout (monolith kept as a fallback)

- `main` — microservices only (the monolith reference code under `src/backend/api`
  is removed here once the cutover is trusted).
- `monolith-legacy` — the last fully-working pure-monolith state
  (commit `171c34e`, before any microservice code), kept so the monolith can be
  redeployed for rollback or comparison.

---

## 7. Known caveats on a single box

- **No isolation:** one service OOM/looping can starve the others. Add per-service
  `mem_limit` / `cpus` in compose if one misbehaves.
- **Kafka is a JVM and the heaviest single newcomer** — it dominates the RAM jump.
- **Build on the box uses swap** — prefer building images off-box and pulling.
- **One Postgres instance** holds all 5 DBs (one process, one backup target). Fine
  for one server; horizontal scale would mean separate instances later.
